# DMHCA HRMS Authentication & User Management System

## 🚀 Production-Ready Features

### ✅ Complete Authentication System:
- **Role-Based Login**: Admin and Employee access with different permissions
- **Account Creation**: Admins can create employee accounts with credentials
- **Profile Management**: Employees can update personal information and change passwords
- **Protected Routes**: All features require authentication
- **Database Security**: Row Level Security (RLS) policies enforced
- **Session Management**: Automatic login/logout with secure token handling

### � User Roles & Capabilities:

#### Admin Users Can:
- **Account Management**: Create new employee accounts with login credentials
- **Full HR Access**: View all employee data, attendance, payroll, leave management
- **System Administration**: Manage attendance machines, reports, and system settings
- **Employee Oversight**: Access to all employee records and attendance data
- **Profile Management**: Update own profile and change password

#### Employee Users Can:
- **Personal Dashboard**: View only their own attendance records and statistics
- **Profile Settings**: Update personal information (name, phone) and change password
- **Attendance Tracking**: View last 30 days of attendance with detailed statistics
- **Secure Access**: Role-based restrictions prevent access to other employee data

### 🔐 Security Features:
- **Database-Level Security**: RLS policies ensure data isolation
- **Password Management**: Secure password changes with current password verification
- **Session Security**: JWT tokens with automatic refresh and secure logout
- **Access Control**: Route-level and component-level permission checks

## 📋 Production Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Database Configuration
1. **Run Database Migration**:
   ```sql
   -- Execute database-auth-migration.sql in Supabase SQL Editor
   -- This creates roles, RLS policies, and user management functions
   ```

2. **Configure RLS Policies**:
   - Policies are automatically created for data isolation
   - Admins can access all data, employees only their own records

### Step 2: Environment Configuration
1. **Frontend Environment** (Create `.env.local`):
   ```bash
   # Copy frontend/.env.example to frontend/.env.local
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
   
   # For admin account creation (development only):
   VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
   ```

2. **Security Best Practices**:
   - ⚠️ **Never expose service role key in production frontend**
   - Use backend API for user creation in production
   - Enable email confirmation in Supabase Auth settings

### Step 3: Initial Admin Account Setup
1. **Create First Admin** (One-time setup):
   - Manually create admin user in Supabase Auth dashboard
   - Add employee record with `role = 'admin'`
   - Link auth user to employee record

2. **Alternative Setup** (Using the system):
   - Temporarily use service role key in development
   - Create admin account through the interface
   - Remove service role key from frontend after setup

### Step 4: Production Deployment
1. **Security Configuration**:
   - Remove `VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` from production
   - Enable email verification in Supabase settings
   - Configure password policies and security rules

2. **User Creation Workflow**:
   - Admins create employee accounts through the interface
   - System automatically sends invitation emails
   - Employees can change passwords after first login

## 🏗️ Architecture

### File Structure:
```
frontend/src/
├── contexts/AuthContext.tsx          # User session & role management
├── components/
│   ├── auth/LoginForm.tsx           # Email/password login form
│   ├── ProtectedRoute.tsx           # Route protection wrapper
│   ├── employee/EmployeeDashboard.tsx # Employee-only dashboard
│   └── common/Header.tsx            # Navigation with user menu
└── App.tsx                          # Updated with role-based routing
```

### Authentication Flow:
1. **Unauthenticated** → Login form displayed
2. **Login Success** → User profile fetched from employees table
3. **Role Detection** → Route to appropriate dashboard:
   - `role: 'admin'` → Full HR system access
   - `role: 'employee'` → Personal dashboard only

### Database Schema:
```sql
employees table:
- auth_user_id (UUID) → Links to auth.users(id)
- role (TEXT) → 'admin' or 'employee'
- employee_id, first_name, last_name, email, etc.

RLS Policies:
- Admins can view/edit all records
- Employees can only view/edit their own records
```

## 🚀 Deployment Status

### ✅ Ready for Production:
- Authentication system is complete and tested
- Database security policies are implemented
- Role-based access control is working
- Frontend builds successfully (691.58 kB → 202.46 kB gzipped)
- All code committed and pushed to GitHub

### 🌐 Next Steps:
1. **Deploy Frontend**: Vercel will automatically deploy from GitHub
2. **Deploy Backend**: Render will deploy the webhook server
3. **Configure Environment**: Set up production Supabase credentials
4. **User Management**: Create actual employee accounts for your organization
